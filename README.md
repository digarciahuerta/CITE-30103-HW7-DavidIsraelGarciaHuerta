Small tutorial on how to complile my programs. 
In your code editor or command prompt where ever you choose to run my programs do these steps
when you write my code into the file or workspace,
compile it with gcc (name of program here with .c)
then run it with ./a.out
and it will run sucessfully if those commands are inputed into your command prompt with my code in your file.
